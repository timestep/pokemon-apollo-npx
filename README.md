# pokemon-apollo-npx

This is a Pokedex app, using a simple Type filter. 
It is designed with the context of the era in mind Windown 95, for aesthetics.


## Technology

This is an app written with create-apollo-app https://apolloapp.org

I've leveraged this CRA to quickly set up key technologies that I wanted to play with and use.

- Typescript
- Apollo
- GraphQl
- React

I've chosen react95 as my component UI kit. https://react95.io

It uses webpack in the background to run and bundle the whole set together.

It uses native state mangament from React, and apollo/gql queries for data fetching.
Typesafety is enforced via Typescript, and can be extended between server/client for a shared schema.

There are no tests, but Jest can easily be integrated.

## Installation

1. Run `yarn`
2. Run `yarn start`
